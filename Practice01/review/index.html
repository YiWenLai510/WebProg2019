                    time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
                    we seek.</blockquote>

            A < div > is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
            and take up the full width available.<br>
            <span>And a < span > tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</span>
