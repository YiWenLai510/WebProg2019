    There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
    instance you can make words <span class="bold">bold</span>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>...
    <br>
    <span class="mark">the</span> <span class="del">list</span> <ins>goes</ins> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.
</p>
<p>
    You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
    <blockquote>
        Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
        time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
        we seek.
    </blockquote>
    not to mention how easy commenting is in html

        Blocks and Inline Elements
    </h1>
    <div>
        A &lt < div > &gt is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
        and take up the full width available.
        <br>
        <br>
        And &lt span &gt tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
